<h1>how to run</h1>
If you have docker installed just use

``docker compose up`` AND create a file called .env if it doesn't already exits
add the lines:

port=
ipinfoToken=

without a valid IpInfo.io token an error will be caught and logged in console. It should still run.

That's it! It should be live on your localhost:3456 if it's unused. If that port is busy change the port in .env.
